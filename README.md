# scripts
A collection of **practical Python scripts** used for real-world tasks and learning.

This repository demonstrates:
- clean and readable code
- automation-oriented engineering mindset
- basic data, files, and database handling
- attention to real production use cases

### What’s inside
- file system utilities (`pathlib`)
- data processing (CSV, JSON, dates)
- ETL-style helpers
- PostgreSQL interaction examples
- logging, configuration, `.env`
- **applied scripts for working with manufacturing and production specifications**  
  (parsing, validation, normalization)

This is **not a library**, but a set of reusable engineering solutions.
